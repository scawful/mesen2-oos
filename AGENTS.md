# Mesen2 Fork Usage

This repository is the active Mesen2 fork used for Oracle of Secrets debugging.

- Use this repo for all Mesen2 changes: `/Users/scawful/src/third_party/forks/Mesen2`.
- Do not edit any other Mesen2 clone or upstream repo unless the user explicitly asks.
- If multiple clones appear to be in use, verify the active one by comparing recent activity
  (e.g., `git log -1 --stat` or file timestamps) and ask the user if it is ambiguous.
- When a task mentions "Mesen2" or emulator debugging for Oracle of Secrets, default to this fork.
